Simple Notes App üìù
This is a minimalistic, console-based Java application that allows a user to save and view simple text notes. All notes are automatically timestamped and saved to a local file named notes.txt. It was built by a learner to practice core Java concepts like file I/O, Scanner input, while loops, and switch statements.

Main Features:
-Write a Note: Saves user input with a timestamp ([MMM dd, yyyy 'at' hh:mm a]) to a file.
-Read Notes: Displays all previously saved notes from the file, numbered for clarity.
-Persistent Storage: Notes are saved to and read from a file named notes.txt, ensuring they persist between application runs.
-Menu-Driven Interface: Easy navigation through a command-line menu.

How to Run:
The entire application is contained within a single file, NotesApp.java.
1.Save the file: Ensure the file NotesApp.java is saved in a local directory.
2.Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder.
3.Compile the code:
     Bash
     javac NotesApp.java
4.Run the program:
     Bash
     java NotesApp
